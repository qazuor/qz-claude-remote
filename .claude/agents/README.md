# Agents

This directory contains agent definitions organized by domain:

- `product/` .. Product-focused agents (specs, requirements, UX)
- `engineering/` .. Engineering agents (code, architecture, DevOps)
- `quality/` .. Quality agents (testing, code review, validation)
- `design/` .. Design agents (UI/UX, visual design)
- `specialized/` .. Domain-specific agents

## Creating Agents

Place agent definition files (`.md`) in the appropriate subdirectory. Each agent should define:

1. **Role** .. What the agent does
2. **Tools** .. Which tools the agent has access to
3. **Instructions** .. Specific guidelines for the agent
